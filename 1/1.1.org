* Historical Definition
- algorism :: (before 1957) arithmetic using Arabic numerals /vs/
              abacist. 

* Algorithm E, /Euclidean Algorithm/
Given two positive integers, /n/ and /m/ , their greatest common divisor can be found by:

- E1 :: \( r = m mod n \)
- E2 :: if r ==  0, terminate, return n
- E3 :: m = n
	n = r
	Go to step 1

* Upon Encountering an Algorithm				  :WiseWords:
Take pencil and paper and work it out.  All other approaches to understanding an algorithm are generally unsuccessful.

* Performance Characteristics
- /e. g./, : number of steps necessary to compute an algorithm, in the case of /E/ average number of steps for completion can be given as:
  \begin{equation} 
  T_{n} = 12((\ln 2) \pi^{2})\ln n
  \end{equation}
