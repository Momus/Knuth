* 1.1

** 1 [ 10 ] Rearange four variables, $(a, b, c, d)$ by sequence of replacements.
\begin{equation} 
1.) a \rightarrow z
2.) d \rightarrow a
3.) c \rightarrow d
4.) b \rightarrow c
5.) z \rightarrow a
\end{equation} 

** 2 [ 15 ] Prove /m/ is always greater than /n/, except possibly the first time.
If /n/ is greater than /m/ then when (modulo n m) is taken, the result will be /n/ itself.  Since that will be set to r, and the value of m will become the first term, the two terms will flip.

** 3 [ 20 ] Write Algorithm E more efficiently
See [[file+emacs:../src/my_gcd.scm][my_gcd.scm]]

** 4 [ 16 ] GCD of 2166 and 6099?
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
scheme@(guile-user)> (my_gcd 2166 6099)
$1 = 57
#+END_SRC

** TODO 5 [ 12 ]
